# Common Time

**Reference-free temporal consensus extractor**

This tool extracts the *common temporal mode* shared across multiple independent clocks or time series,
without assuming any physical origin.

## What it does
- Ingests multiple time series
- Removes individual drifts
- Extracts the common mode via PCA
- Outputs S(t), confidence, and diagnostics

No cosmology. No philosophy. Just signal.
