# Commercial Use & Licensing — Common-Time

This document describes how **Common-Time** can be used in commercial contexts.

It is intended for organizations evaluating Common-Time as an **embeddable engine**.

---

## 1. Product nature

Common-Time is provided as a **coherence-based temporal reference engine**.

It is designed to be:
- embedded into existing systems,
- integrated by technical teams,
- used as a foundational capability rather than a finished application.

Common-Time is **not** delivered as a turnkey solution or SaaS product.

---

## 2. Licensing model (overview)

Commercial use of Common-Time is based on **engine licensing**.

The license grants the right to:
- use the Common-Time engine,
- embed it within internal or commercial systems,
- deploy it on-premise or in private infrastructure,
- receive engine updates according to license terms.

The license does **not** include domain-specific customization.

---

## 3. Scope of responsibility

### What ErvraTech provides
- the Common-Time engine
- documented APIs and behavior
- general-purpose updates and maintenance
- bug fixes affecting the core engine

### What the licensee is responsible for
- system integration
- domain-specific tuning
- data quality and preprocessing
- operational deployment and monitoring
- compliance with regulatory or industry constraints

Common-Time is provided **as an engineering component**, not as an operational service.

---

## 4. What is explicitly out of scope

The following are **not included** in the engine license unless separately contracted:

- business or domain adaptation
- application-level design
- validation on client-specific datasets
- responsibility for downstream decisions
- real-time control guarantees

---

## 5. Integration philosophy

Common-Time is intentionally **context-agnostic**.

This ensures that:
- the engine remains generic and reusable,
- integration choices remain under the client’s control,
- the engine can be applied across domains without modification.

Integration patterns may include:
- libraries
- internal services
- batch processing components
- analytics pipelines

---

## 6. Support & services (optional)

Optional services may be offered separately:
- integration guidance
- architectural review
- limited technical support
- evaluation licenses

These services do **not** alter the generic nature of the engine.

---

## 7. Open and commercial usage

Community or open usage may be permitted under a separate license.

Commercial embedding, redistribution, or internal production use requires a **commercial engine license**.

Please refer to the repository license file or contact ErvraTech for details.

## Summary

Common-Time is licensed as an **embeddable engine**.

It provides a generic temporal coherence capability, while integration, adaptation, and operational responsibility remain with the licensee.

This separation ensures technical clarity, scalability, and long-term sustainability.
